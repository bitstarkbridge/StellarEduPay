/**
 * resolveSchool — middleware that identifies the current school from the request.
 *
 * Lookup strategy (in order of precedence):
 *   1. X-School-ID header   — opaque schoolId string (e.g. "SCH-3F2A")
 *   2. X-School-Slug header — human slug (e.g. "lincoln-high")
 *
 * Results are cached in memory with a 5-minute TTL to reduce DB load.
 *
 * On success: attaches req.school (lean School doc) and req.schoolId (string).
 * On failure: 400 if no header provided, 404 if school not found or inactive.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   router.use(resolveSchool);           // apply to all routes in a router
 *   router.get('/students', resolveSchool, handler);  // apply to one route
